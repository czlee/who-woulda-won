**Who Woulda Won?** is a simple web app that, given the scoresheet of a dance competition final, shows you who would've won if other voting systems (than relative placement) had been used.

You can find it at https://www.whowouldawon.dance/.

I made it as a first foray into vibe-coding using Claude Code, figuring it was a good candidate because

- I've long wanted this app to exist, so I had a particular idea in mind
- It's very simple: just one endpoint, can be serverless, no need for persistent storage
- It's low stakes: nothing else relies on it

(I ended up monitoring and directing the coding a lot more actively than I originally imagined I would, but it was still much faster than if I had been writing all the code myself.)
