            <h3 id="why-did-i-write-this">
                Why did I write this app?
                <a href="#why-did-i-write-this" class="permalink">#</a>
            </h3>
            <p>[Your answer here. E.g.: I was curious whether different voting systems would have produced different outcomes at competitions I'd attended or competed in, so I built a tool to check.]</p>

            <h3 id="what-is-a-voting-system">
                What is a voting system?
                <a href="#what-is-a-voting-system" class="permalink">#</a>
            </h3>
            <p>[Your answer here. E.g.: A voting system is a method for aggregating individual preferences — in this case, judges' rankings of competitors — into an overall result. Different systems can produce different winners from the same set of ballots.]</p>

            <h3 id="is-rp-a-bad-system">
                Is Relative Placement a bad system?
                <a href="#is-rp-a-bad-system" class="permalink">#</a>
            </h3>
            <p>[Your answer here. E.g.: Not necessarily. RP was designed with dance competitions in mind, and it has properties that work well in that context. But like all voting systems, it can behave unexpectedly in edge cases — which is part of what makes comparing systems interesting.]</p>

            <h3 id="which-system-is-best">
                Which voting system is best?
                <a href="#which-system-is-best" class="permalink">#</a>
            </h3>
            <p>[Your answer here. E.g.: There's no universally "best" system — Arrow's impossibility theorem shows that no ranked voting system can satisfy all desirable criteria simultaneously. Each system makes different trade-offs.]</p>

            <h3 id="how-often-do-systems-disagree">
                How often do the systems disagree?
                <a href="#how-often-do-systems-disagree" class="permalink">#</a>
            </h3>
            <p>[Your answer here. E.g.: In practice, the systems agree on the winner more often than not, especially when judging panels are large. Disagreements are more common further down the results, and become more likely with smaller panels.]</p>
